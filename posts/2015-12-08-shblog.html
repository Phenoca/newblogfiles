<p>This is the UNIX philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.<br />

<p>i recently started using Ypnose's <a href="https://github.com/Ypnose/wswsh">wswsh</a> as a static site generator. i am just playing with it right now, but i really appreciate the simplicity of this tool. Ypnose writes more about wswsh in his own <a href="http://ywstd.fr/blog/2013/blogging-shell.html">blog</a> for anyone interested in giving it a try.</p>
