# swimsignal

development on swimsignal came to an end in may (2015). it is a long story and in the interest of not being the guy to air dirty laundry on his personal blog i wonâ€™t go into detail about why and how work on this project came to an end. more important to me than the end is what has come of the work i put into swimsignal. i am using my work as the basis for a series of tutorials that will assist anyone interested in making a device similar to swimsignal in doing so. along the way there will be tutorials on python scripting, opencv, interfacing a raspberry pi with sensors and a few other fun things. i hope to have the first tutorial up mid to late september. i also hope to include some links to other projects similar to swimsignal, so if you know of one please forward me a link to some info on the project.


if you are interested in having a look you will be able to find the tutorials [here.](http://swimsignal.com)
