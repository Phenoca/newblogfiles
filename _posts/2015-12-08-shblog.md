# using mksh to write a blog

i recently started using Ypnose's [wswsh](https://github.com/Ypnose/wswsh) as a static site generator. i am just playing with it right now, but i really appreciate the simplicity of this tool. Ypnose writes more about wswsh in his own [blog](http://ywstd.fr/blog/2013/blogging-shell.html) for anyone interested in giving it a try.
